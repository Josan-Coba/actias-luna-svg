This adorable moth has been _written_ by me to help me put into practice some of the things I have been learning about SVG and SMIL.

My main learning resource has been the amazing book 'Using SVG with CSS3 and HTML5: Vector Graphics for Web Design', by Amelia Bellamy-Royds, Kurt Cagle, and Dudley Storey (O'Reilly, 2017). I would also recommend the wonderful ['A Guide to SVG Animations (SMIL)'](https://css-tricks.com/guide-svg-animations-smil/) by Sara Soueidan (originally published in 2014, last updated 2018), and the always great and handy [MDN Resources](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG).
